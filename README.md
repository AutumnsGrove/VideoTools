# VideoTools üé•

A collection of Python utilities for video processing, file synchronization, and batch file management. These tools were designed to streamline common video workflow tasks and provide easy-to-use interfaces for file operations.

## üöÄ Tools Overview

### üìÅ `file_verifier.py`
**Modern Gradio interface for file existence verification**

A web-based tool that helps you track which files from a batch processing queue still exist versus which have been processed or moved. Perfect for resuming interrupted video compression tasks.

**Features:**
- Parse space-separated or newline-separated file paths
- Categorize files into "Missing/Processed" and "Ready for Processing"
- Display file details (modification time, size) in a clean table
- Copy-paste ready file paths for continuing batch operations
- Modern, responsive UI with Inter font and neutral color scheme

**Usage:**
```bash
python file_verifier.py
# Opens web interface on http://localhost:7861
```

**Created with:** Claude Code for solving the common problem of tracking batch processing progress when operations are interrupted.

### üîÑ `sync.py`
**Camera file synchronization utility**

Intelligent file synchronization tool for organizing camera files (photos/videos) from DCIM folders into date-based directory structures.

**Features:**
- Automatic date-based folder organization
- Duplicate detection and handling
- Progress tracking with real-time updates
- Comprehensive logging
- Safe file operations with verification

**Key Functions:**
- `CameraSync`: Main synchronization class
- `print_progress()`: Real-time progress indicators
- Smart date extraction from file metadata
- Conflict resolution for duplicate files

---

### ‚ö° `sync_concurrent.py`
**High-performance concurrent file synchronization**

Enhanced version of the sync utility with concurrent processing capabilities for handling large file sets efficiently.

**Features:**
- Multi-threaded file operations
- Concurrent duplicate detection
- Enhanced performance for large datasets
- Maintains all safety features of the base sync tool

---

### üé¨ `video_analyzer.py`
**AI-powered video content analysis**

Advanced video analysis tool powered by Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct vision model for intelligent video content understanding.

**Features:**
- Vision-language model integration
- Video frame analysis and interpretation
- AI-powered content description
- Gradio web interface for easy interaction

**Requirements:**
- PyTorch with CUDA support
- Transformers library
- Qwen2.5-VL model (7B parameters)
- Flash Attention 2 for optimized performance

---

### üéûÔ∏è `video_combiner.py`
**Intelligent video concatenation and merging**

Professional-grade video combination tool with smart file grouping, quality analysis, and batch processing capabilities.

**Features:**
- Automatic video grouping by date/time
- Quality and format analysis
- FFmpeg-based concatenation
- Comprehensive logging and error handling
- Progress tracking for batch operations
- Human-readable file size and duration reporting

**Key Functions:**
- `VideoCombiner`: Main processing class
- Smart video grouping algorithms
- Quality-aware merging decisions
- Robust error handling and recovery
